            The following page contains the derivation and implementation of a 1-dimensional version of
            <a href="https://adcirc.org">ADCIRC</a>. The purpose of this exercise is threefold:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create a simplified version of ADCIRC that can be used to quickly and easily test new features that
                may eventually be implemented in ADCIRC itself. For example, we will use this implementation to
                explore the coupling of shallow water models with short wave and SPH (smooth particle hydrodynamics)
                models.
            </li>
            <li>
                Provide a deeper understanding of ADCIRC, the shallow water equations, and finite element analysis in
                general. I have yet to find an extremely thorough 1D finite element derivation that uses the shallow
                water equations, so I hope to fill that gap. Additionally, I am approaching this problem as an
                engineering student who has been through a number of finite element analysis courses, finding some
                aspects straightforward, and others challenging. My hope is that anybody else who discovers this page
                will find something to further their understanding. This includes myself, when I inevitably return
                to finite elements from working on another project and find myself having forgotten most of the details.
            </li>
            <li>
                I know there's another one, I can't really remember it right now, though.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It may prove beneficial to follow along with the actual
            <a href="http://www.unc.edu/ims/adcirc/adcirc_theory_2004_12_08.pdf">ADCIRC Theory Report and Formulation</a>
            document as you work through this page. I try to follow it closely, filling in gaps where they leave steps
            to the reader and, obviously, switching things to one dimension instead of two.
